> _AWS, Docker, TensorFlow, Flask, ExpressJS, MongoDB, ReactJS_

### [Calculator](https://calcproject.johnfarrell.io)

Inspired by the [TI-84 Plus CE](https://education.ti.com/en/products/calculators/graphing-calculators/ti-84-plus-ce), I created a web-based graphing calculator. This was built in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator supports simple graphing and functions.

> _HTML, CSS, JavaScript_

### [Collegy](https://collegy.org)

Collegy is a project I built with a friend over 2 weeks in 2022. It is a platform to help students discover college fits, with a specialized college recommendation algorithm. Furthermore, there is a search function, allowing you to easily explore and compare different colleges to find the best fit for your needs and goals.

> _MongoDB, ReactJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, and ChakraUI_

### [Concurrency](https://balls.johnfarrell.io)

This project attempts to simulate concurrency. Each ball is tied to a separate website ping. The balls will bounce with gravity, growing and shrinking depending on the ping time between designated websites.

> _HTML, CSS, JavaScript_

### [Machine Learning Speed Ratings](https://github.com/johnsfarrell/speed-ratings)

The goal of this project is to create an accurate machine learning model to predict the speed rating of all finishers in any given race in New York State. The model will be trained, valuated, and tested on speed ratings from 2014 to 2019 along with weather data from the National Centers for Environmental Information and course specific information from Tully Runner's and Milesplit. The hope is that this model can be applied to future high school cross country races and produce a higher quantity of accurate speed ratings.

> _Python, TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy_

### [Connections](https://johnsfarrell.github.io/connections/)

My recreation of the [NY Times' Connections](https://www.nytimes.com/games/connections). This project was built in around 1 hour during my data science lab :)

> _ReactJS_

### [Stock Analysis](https://github.com/johnsfarrell/analysis-proj)

This project analyzed the entire stock market, soley based on fundamental analysis from analysts across Wall Street. The project involved a heavy amount of webscraping and data cleaning. Report and algorithms available in the repository.

> _Python, Web Scraping, MongoDB_
