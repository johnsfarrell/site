			Hey! I'm a student at Brown studying Computer Science and Mathematics. 
			I am particularly interested in software design and machine learning,
			and the challenges faced at the intersection of the two.
			<br /><br />
			I've been a TA for both undergraduate and graduate computer science courses at Brown, 
			covering material ranging from introductory programming to <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/degrees/cybersecurity/">advanced cybersecurity</a>.
			In the fall, I work as a <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/degrees/undergrad/jobs/hta/">Head TA</a> coordinating a staff of UTAs and a class of ~200 students. I am passionate about the importance of peer education and the role TAs can play
			in fostering an inclusive learning environment. 
			<br /><br />
			I have some previous industry experience as a software engineer intern at 
			<a href="https://sharpnotions.com/">Sharp Notions</a> and <a href="https://meetpaidly.com/">Paidly</a>. 
			The small team sizes and fast-paced environments at these companies gave me the opportunity and resources to work on a <a href="/cv#experience">variety of projects</a>. This summer I am working as a mobile development intern at <a href="https://billmax.com/">BillMax</a> and a research assistant for Brown Unveristy Professor and New York Time's Best Seller <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/population-studies/people/person/emily-oster">Emily Oster</a>, developing <a href="https://zelma.ai">Zelma AI</a>!
